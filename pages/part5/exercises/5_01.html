  <h1>Exercise 5.01:</h1>
  
  This exercise doesn't rely on previous exercises. You may again choose which ever technologies you want for the implementation.

  We need a *DummySite* resource that can be used to create a html page from any url.

  1. Create a "DummySite" resource that takes has a string property called "website_url".

  2. Create a controller that creates all of the required resources that are required for the functionality.

  Refer to [https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/client-libraries/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/client-libraries/) for information about client libraries.

  The API docs are here for the apiGroups and example requests: [https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.18](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.18)

  Test that creating a DummySite resource with website_url "[https://example.com/](https://example.com/)" should create a copy of the website.

  <p style="color:firebrick;">The controller doesn't have to work perfectly in all circumstances. The following workflow should succeed: 1. apply role, account and binding. 2. apply deployment. 3. apply DummySite</p>
