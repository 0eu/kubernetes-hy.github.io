  <h1>Exercise 2.09: Daily todos</h1>

  Create a CronJob that generates a new todo every day to remind you to do 'Read < URL >'.

  Where < URL > is a wikipedia article that was decided by the job randomly. It does not have to be a hyperlink, the user can copy paste the url from the todo.

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random responds with a redirect to a random wikipedia page so you can ask it to provide a random article for you to read. TIP: Check location header
