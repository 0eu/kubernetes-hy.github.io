  <h1>Exercise 3.01:</h1>
  
  Deploy the main application as well as the ping / pong application into GKE. 
  
  Pingpong does not have to respond from /pingpong anymore, so you can remove ingress. Or read about using ingress [here](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/ingress).

  If your postgres logs say

  ```console
initdb: error: directory "/var/lib/postgresql/data" exists but is not empty
It contains a lost+found directory, perhaps due to it being a mount point.
Using a mount point directly as the data directory is not recommended.
Create a subdirectory under the mount point.
  ```

  you can add subPath configuration:

  **statefulset.yaml**
  ```yaml
...
  volumeMounts:
  - name: data
    mountPath: /var/lib/postgresql/data
    subPath: postgres
...
  ```

  This will create a postgres directory where the data will reside. subPaths also make it possible to use single volume for multiple purposes.
