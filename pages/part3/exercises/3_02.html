  <h1>Exercise 3.02: Back to Ingress</h1>
  
  Deploy the main application as well as the ping / pong application into GKE with ingress.

  Unfortunately since GKE Ingress does not have rewrites or rewrite policy like traefik had with "PathPrefixStrip" [yet](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-gce/issues/109) pingpong will have to respond from /pingpong path.
