## Google Kubernetes Engine ##

We have used Kubernetes distribution k3s using docker containers via k3d. In a production environment the task of maintaining a Kubernetes cluster is often left to third parties. A managed Kubernetes as a service is often the best choice as the additional work required in maintenance exceeds the benefits of a personal cluster. In some, somewhat rare, cases setting up and maintaining your own cluster is a reasonable option. A case for it would be that your company/organization already has the hardware and/or wants to stay independent from providers, one such example could be a University. 

Even in Kubernetes then the cost for running a software that is rarely used may be higher than the value it generates. In such cases using [Serverless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serverless_computing) solutions could be more cost efficient. Kubernetes can get really expensive really fast.

Let's focus on the Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) costs for now. Note that the GKE costs a little bit more than its competitors.

The calculator here [https://cloud.google.com/products/calculator](https://cloud.google.com/products/calculator) offers us a picture of the pricing. I decided to try a cheap option: 6 nodes in 1 zonal cluster using 1 vCPU each. Datacenter location is in Finland and I don't need persistent disk. If we wanted less than 6 nodes why would we even use Kubernetes. The total cost for this example was 145â‚¬ - $160 per month. Adding additional services such as a Load balancer increase the cost.

During the part 3 we will be using GKE either by using the student credits or the free credits offered by google. You are responsible for making sure that the credits last for the whole part and if all of them are consumed I can not help you.

After redeeming the credits we can create a project with the billing account. The google cloud UI can be confusing. On the [resources page](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-resource-manager) we can create a new project and let's name it "dwk-gke" for the purposes of this course. After creating this project make sure that the project is linked to the correct billing account from the top left dropdown and billing and then "Account Management". It should look like this (account is "DevOps with Kubernetes" and project "dwk-gke"):

![]({{ "/images/part3/gke_billing.png" | absolute_url }})

Install the Google Cloud SDK. Instructions [here](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/install). After that login and set the previously created project to be used.

```console
$ gcloud -v
  Google Cloud SDK 290.0.1
  bq 2.0.56
  core 2020.04.24
  gsutil 4.49

$ gcloud auth login
  ...
  You are now logged in

$ gcloud config set project dwk-gke
  Updated property [core/project].
```

We can now create a cluster. We can choose any zone we want from the list [here](https://cloud.google.com/about/locations/). I chose Finland:

```console
$ gcloud container clusters create dwk-cluster --zone=europe-north1-b
  ...
  Creating cluster dwk-cluster in europe-north1-b...
  ...
  NAME         LOCATION         MASTER_VERSION  MASTER_IP       MACHINE_TYPE   NODE_VERSION    NUM_NODES  STATUS
  dwk-cluster  europe-north1-b  1.14.10-gke.27  35.228.239.103  n1-standard-1  1.14.10-gke.27  3          RUNNING
```

As we did with k3d we need to set kubeconfig so kubectl can access it:

```console
$ gcloud container clusters get-credentials dwk-cluster --zone=europe-north1-b
  Fetching cluster endpoint and auth data.
  kubeconfig entry generated for dwk-cluster.

$ kubectl cluster info
```

Now that we have a cluster it's used almost exactly like the one we had locally. Let's apply this application that creates a random string and then serves an image based on that random string. This will create 6 replicas of the process "seedimage".

```console
$ kubectl apply -f 
```

Now as a warning the next step is going to add into the [cost of the cluster](https://cloud.google.com/compute/all-pricing#lb) as well. Let's add a *LoadBalancer* Service!

```yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: seedimage-svc
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer # This should be the only unfamiliar part
  selector:
    app: seedimage
  ports:
    - port: 80
      protocol: TCP
      targetPort: 3000
```

A load balancer service asks for google services to provision us a load balancer. We can wait until the service gets an external ip:

```console
$ kubectl get svc --watch
  NAME            TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP    PORT(S)        AGE
  kubernetes      ClusterIP      10.31.240.1     <none>         443/TCP        144m
  seedimage-svc   LoadBalancer   10.31.241.224   35.228.41.16   80:30215/TCP   94s
```

If we now access http://35.228.41.16 with our browser we'll see the application up and running. By refreshing the page we can also see that the load balancer sometimes offers us a different image.
