  <h1>Exercise 4.06: Project v2.0</h1>

  Create a new separate service for sending status messages of the todos to a popular chat application. Let's call the new service "broadcaster".

  Requirements:
  1. The backend saving / updating todos should send a message to NATS
  2. The broadcaster should subscribe to NATS messages
  3. The broadcaster should send the message forward to an external service in a format they support

  Choose either:
   - Telegram
   - Slack
   - Discord
  
  or if you don't want to use them use "Generic" where an URL is set as an Environment variable and the payload is e.g.

```json
{
  "user": "bot",
  "message": "A todo was created"
}
```

  The broadcaster should be able to be scaled without sending the message multiple times. Test that it can run with 6 replicas without issues. The messages only have to be sent to the external service if all of the services are working correctly. So a randomly missing message is not an issue but a duplicate is.
