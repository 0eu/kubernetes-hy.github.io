  <h1>Exercise 4.01: Readiness Probe</h1>

  Create a ReadinessProbe for "ping/pong" application. It should be ready when it has a connection to database.

  And another ReadinessProbe for "main" application. It should be ready when it can receive data from pingpong application.

  Test that it works by applying everything but the database statefulset. The output of `kubectl get po` should look like this before the database is available:

  ```console
NAME                           READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
mainapp-dep-7f49547cf4-ttj4f   1/2     Running   0          21s
pingpong-dep-9b698d6fb-jdgq9   0/1     Running   0          21s
  ```

  Adding the database should automatically move the READY states to 2/2 and 1/1 for main and pingpong respectively.
