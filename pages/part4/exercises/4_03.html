  <h1>Exercise 4.03: Prometheus</h1>

  We've been using Prometheus since part 2, but basically we've only heard the name and seen some nice graphs on Grafana. Let's do a single hands-on query to learn more.

  Start a Prometheus with helm (see part 2) and use port-forward to access the gui website. Port 9090 is the default for Prometheus:

```console
$ kubectl -n prometheus get pods
  NAME                                                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
  prometheus-operator-159525-operator-7ccb8df999-cnx2g              2/2     Running   0          2m30s
  prometheus-operator-1595250757-prometheus-node-exporter-n69gb     1/1     Running   0          2m30s
  prometheus-operator-1595250757-prometheus-node-exporter-m6fq9     1/1     Running   0          2m30s
  prometheus-operator-1595250757-prometheus-node-exporter-xbl4h     1/1     Running   0          2m30s
  prometheus-operator-1595250757-kube-state-metrics-679fc685x2gkq   1/1     Running   0          2m30s
  alertmanager-prometheus-operator-159525-alertmanager-0            2/2     Running   0          2m19s
  prometheus-operator-1595250757-grafana-598f6dbbdf-28l6z           2/2     Running   0          2m30s
  prometheus-prometheus-operator-159525-prometheus-0                3/3     Running   0          2m7s 

$ kubectl -n prometheus port-forward prometheus-prometheus-operator-159525-prometheus-0 9090
  Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:9090 -> 9090
  Forwarding from [::1]:9090 -> 9090
```

  And now accessing [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090) will allow us to write queries. **Write a query** that shows the number of pods created by StatefulSets in "prometheus" namespace. For the above setup the "Value" should be 2 different pods. Something similar:

  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr><td>Element</td><td>Value</td></tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr><td>Scalar</td><td>2</td></tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  Query for "kube_pod_info" should have the required fields to filter through. See [documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/) for help with querying.
