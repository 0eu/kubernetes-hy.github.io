  <h1>Exercise 4.04: Project v1.8</h1>

  Create an AnalysisTemplate for the project that will follow the cpu usage of all containers in the namespace.

  If the CPU usage **rate** sum for the namespace increases above a set value (you may choose a good hardcoded value for your project, may vary) within 10 minutes revert the update.

  Make sure that the application doesn't get updated if the value is set too low.
