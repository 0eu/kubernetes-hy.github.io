  <h1>Exercise 1.02: Project v0.1</h1>
  
  **Project can be done with any language and framework you want**
  
  The project is a simple todo application with the familiar features of create, read, update, and delete (CRUD). We'll develop it during all parts of this course. At the end it will look like this:

  // TODO IMAGE HERE

  Keep this in mind if you want to avoid doing more work than necessary.

  Let's get started!
  
  Create a web server that outputs "Server started in port NNNN" when it's started and deploy it into your Kubernetes cluster. You won't have access to the port yet but that'll come soon.
