  <h1>Exercise 1.02: Project v0.1</h1>
  
  **Project can be done with any language and framework you want**
  
  The project is a simple todo application with the familiar features of create, read, update, and delete (CRUD).
  
  Create a web server that outputs "Server started in port NNNN" when it's started and deploy it into your Kubernetes cluster. You won't have access to the port yet but that'll come soon.
