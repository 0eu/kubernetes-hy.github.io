  <h1>Exercise 1.12: Project v0.6</h1>

  Since the project looks really boring at the moment let's add some outside resources.
  
  A daily image where every day a new image is fetched on the first request.
  
  Get an image from Lorem Picsum like `https://picsum.photos/1200` and display it in the project. Make sure to cache the image into a volume so we don't spam the API for new images every time we access the application or the container crashes.
