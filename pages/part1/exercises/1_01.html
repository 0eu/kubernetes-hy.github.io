  <h1>Exercise 1.01: Getting started</h1>
  
  **Exercises can be done with any language and framework you want.**
  
  Create an application that generates a random string on startup, stores this string into memory and outputs it every 5 seconds with a timestamp. e.g.
  
  ```plaintext
2020-03-30T12:15:17.705Z: 8523ecb1-c716-4cb6-a044-b9e83bb98e43
2020-03-30T12:15:22.705Z: 8523ecb1-c716-4cb6-a044-b9e83bb98e43
  ```
  
  Deploy it into your Kubernetes cluster and confirm that it's running with `kubectl logs ...`
  
  In the future exercises this application will be referred too as "Main application". We will revisit some exercise applications during the course.
