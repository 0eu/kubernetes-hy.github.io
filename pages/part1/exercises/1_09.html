  <h1>Exercise 1.09: More services</h1>
  
  Develop a second application that simply responds with "pong 0" to a GET request and increases a counter (the 0) so that you can see how many requests have been sent. The counter should be in memory so it may reset at some point.
  Create a new deployment for it and use ingress to route requests directed '/pingpong' to it.
  
  In future exercises, this second application will be referred to as "ping/pong application"

  This is not required, but you can add the following annotation to your ingress so that the path in ingress is stripped from the request. This'll allow you to use "/pingpong" path whilst the ping-pong application listens on "/":

  ```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    traefik.ingress.kubernetes.io/rule-type: "PathPrefixStrip"
  ```
