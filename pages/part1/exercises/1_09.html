  <h1>Exercise 1.09: More services</h1>
  
  Develop a second application that simply responds with "pong 0" to a GET request and increases a counter (the 0) so that you can see how many requests have been sent. The counter should be in memory so it may reset at some point.
  Create a new deployment for it and use ingress to route requests directed '/ping' to it.
  
  In future exercises this second application will be referred to as "ping/pong application"
